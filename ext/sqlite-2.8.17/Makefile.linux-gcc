# Makefile for SQLITE
#
# This is a template makefile for SQLite.  Most people prefer to
# use the autoconf generated "configure" script to generate the
# makefile automatically.  But that does not work for everybody
# and in every situation.  If you are having problems with the
# "configure" script, you might want to try this makefile as an
# alternative.  Create a copy of this file, edit the parameters
# below and type "make".
#

#### The toplevel directory of the source tree.  This is the directory
#    that contains this "Makefile.in" and the "configure.in" script.
#
TOP = ../sqlite

#### C Compiler and options for use in building executables that
#    will run on the platform that is doing the build.
#
BCC = gcc -g -O2
#BCC = /opt/ancic/bin/c89 -0

#### If the target operating system supports the "usleep()" system
#    call, then define the HAVE_USLEEP macro for all C modules.
#
#USLEEP = 
USLEEP = -DHAVE_USLEEP=1

#### If you want the SQLite library to be safe for use within a 
#    multi-threaded program, then define the following macro
#    appropriately:
#
#THREADSAFE = -DTHREADSAFE=1
THREADSAFE = -DTHREADSAFE=0

#### Specify any extra linker options needed to make the library
#    thread safe
#
#THREADLIB = -lpthread
THREADLIB = 

#### Leave MEMORY_DEBUG undefined for maximum speed.  Use MEMORY_DEBUG=1
#    to check for memory leaks.  Use MEMORY_DEBUG=2 to print a log of all
#    malloc()s and free()s in order to track down memory leaks.
#    
#    SQLite uses some expensive assert() statements in the inner loop.
#    You can make the library go almost twice as fast if you compile
#    with -DNDEBUG=1
#
#OPTS = -DMEMORY_DEBUG=2
#OPTS = -DMEMORY_DEBUG=1
#OPTS = 
OPTS = -DNDEBUG=1

#### The suffix to add to executable files.  ".exe" for windows.
#    Nothing for unix.
#
#EXE = .exe
EXE =

#### C Compile and options for use in building executables that 
#    will run on the target platform.  This is usually the same
#    as BCC, unless you are cross-compiling.
#
TCC = gcc -O6
#TCC = gcc -g -O0 -Wall
#TCC = gcc -g -O0 -Wall -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage
#TCC = /opt/mingw/bin/i386-mingw32-gcc -O6
#TCC = /opt/ansic/bin/c89 -O +z -Wl,-a,archive

#### Tools used to build a static library.
#
AR = ar cr
#AR = /opt/mingw/bin/i386-mingw32-ar cr
RANLIB = ranlib
#RANLIB = /opt/mingw/bin/i386-mingw32-ranlib

#### Extra compiler options needed for programs that use the TCL library.
#
#TCL_FLAGS =
#TCL_FLAGS = -DSTATIC_BUILD=1
TCL_FLAGS = -I/home/drh/tcltk/8.4linux
#TCL_FLAGS = -I/home/drh/tcltk/8.4win -DSTATIC_BUILD=1
#TCL_FLAGS = -I/home/drh/tcltk/8.3hpux

#### Linker options needed to link against the TCL library.
#
#LIBTCL = -ltcl -lm -ldl
LIBTCL = /home/drh/tcltk/8.4linux/libtcl8.4g.a -lm -ldl
#LIBTCL = /home/drh/tcltk/8.4win/libtcl84s.a -lmsvcrt
#LIBTCL = /home/drh/tcltk/8.3hpux/libtcl8.3.a -ldld -lm -lc

#### Compiler options needed for programs that use the readline() library.
#
#READLINE_FLAGS =
READLINE_FLAGS = -DHAVE_READLINE=1 -I/usr/include/readline

#### Linker options needed by programs using readline() must link against.
#
#LIBREADLINE =
LIBREADLINE = -static -lreadline -ltermcap

#### Should the database engine assume text is coded as UTF-8 or iso8859?
#
# ENCODING  = UTF8
ENCODING = ISO8859

# You should not have to change anything below this line
